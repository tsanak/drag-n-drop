# drag-n-drop

> Drag and drop components into slots

Drag and drop images(components) from one component to another, using vddl.

### #slot1 
takes only small images (max # of images = 4), distributed on 4 rows of 1 column

### #slot2 
takes only big images (max # of images = 6), distributed on 2 rows of 3 columns

P.S: sorry for the worst design ever made ðŸ˜¬
